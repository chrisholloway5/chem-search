# Image URL Test

Testing the corrected image URLs for GitHub README:

![3D Molecular Structure Viewer](assets/images/3D%20Molecular%20Structure%20Viewer.png)
![Molecule Analyzer](assets/images/Molecule%20Analyzer.png)
![Chemical Format Converter](assets/images/Chemical%20Format%20Converter.png)
![AI Chemistry Assistant](assets/images/AI%20Chemistry%20Assistant.png)
![Chemical Database Search](assets/images/Chemical%20Database%20Search.png)
![Research Paper Search](assets/images/Research%20Paper%20Search.png)

## URL Format Explanation

The corrected URLs use:
- Forward slashes (`/`) instead of backslashes (`\`)
- Correct path: `assets/images/` instead of `\assets\`
- URL encoding for spaces: `%20` instead of literal spaces
- Correct file extension: `.png` instead of `.php`
- No leading slash (relative path from repository root)

These URLs will work correctly on GitHub when the README is displayed.
